********************************************************************************

Description
===========
Library for symbolic algebra using a simple expression type Expr which instances
Num, Fractional, and Floating. These expressions can be turned into pretty
Graphviz plots. They can also be differentated in forward and reverse modes.

This library started so that I could better learn both Haskell and automatic
differentiation. We'll see where it goes in the future.

Documentation
=============
See Numeric/Dvda/Examples.hs
